OpenCV or Image Processing Discussion points:

1. What is Computer Vision
  Itâ€™s Subset of AI. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with
  how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from images or videos
  
2. What are all computer vision libraries?
  OpenCV in C++,Python, Java
  
3. How many algorithms are there in OpenCV ?
  Around 2500 optimized algorithms
  
4. What is CUDA ?
  CUDA is a parallel computing platfomr and API interface model created by NVIDIA, which allows to use CUDA enabled GPU for general purpose

5. What is openGL ? 
  Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface(API)
  for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU),
  to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.
  
6. What are machine learning algorithms available in openCV ?
   Normal Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neibhor, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Boosting
   Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Trees, Extremely randomized trees

7. What is Image Stitching ?
  Image stitching or photo stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images
  with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image.
  
8. How to do image Stiching in openCV
  Stitcher::Status status = stitcher->stitch(imgs, pano); input-imgs, output-pano
   
9. What is computational photography ?
  Computational photography refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation
  instead of optical processes. Computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features
  that were not possible at all with film based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements.
  
10. How to do computational photography in openCV?
    a. Image Denoising (removing noise from image)
    - cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising() - works with a single grayscale images
    - cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored() - works with a color image.
    - cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingMulti() - works with image sequence captured in short period of time (grayscale images)
    - cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColoredMulti() - same as above, but for color images.
    b. Image Inpainting (remove small noises, strokes etc in old photographs by a method called inpainting)
      img = cv2.imread('messi_2.jpg')
      mask = cv2.imread('mask2.png',0)
      dst = cv2.inpaint(img,mask,3,cv2.INPAINT_TELEA)
