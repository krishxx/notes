1. How can you connect your webcam to opencv?
CvCapture* mycapWebcam = cvCaptureFromCAM(0); 

2. How can you do objection detection in opencv ?
  using haar cascades
  -Load the cascades
  -Read the video stream
  -Detect and Display
  
3. What are face recognition algorithms ?
   Haar Cascades, Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces
   
4. Eigefaces?
  Characteristic features are called eigenfaces in the facial recognition domain (or principal components generally).
  They can be extracted out of original image data by means of a mathematical tool called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
 
5. How a haar cascading filter works?
  classifier (namely a cascade of boosted classifiers working with haar-like features) is trained with a few hundred
  sample views of a particular object (i.e., a face or a car), called positive examples, that are scaled to the same
  size (say, 20x20), and negative examples - arbitrary images of the same size.
  
6. How many types of image filters are there in openCV ?
  - Averaging
  - Gaussian Filtering
  - Median Filtering
  - Bilateral Filtering
  
7. Feature detection in opencv ?
  Step 1: Detect the keypoints using SURF Detector
  Step 2: Draw keypoints
  step 3: Show detected (drawn) keypoints
